<h2>Column/Group overrides</h2>

<p>Column overrides allow you to change the style of a specific data column group. This can be useful for combining
    different graph styles eg. lines and bars, overriding a colour, changing the order or applying a class so further
    styling options can be defined in css.</p>

<p>There is a text area for each column and you can add multiple settings per column. Add each setting on a new
    line and separate setting name and value with a pipe (|). Eg.</p>

<pre>
type|line
color|#cccccc
weight|20
legend|hide
</pre>

<h3>Available overrides</h3>

<h4>type</h4>

<p>Eg. If your graph is bar chart, you could use this to set one of the columns to be a line for something
    like an average, or representing data that is slightly different than the rest.</p>

<p><strong>Available options:</strong> line, spline, bar, area, area-spline or scatter</p>

<h4>color</h4>

<p>Override the colour on a specific column. Use a <a href="http://www.color-hex.com/" target="_blank">hex value</a>.
    Eg. #000000 = black.</p>

<h4>legend</h4>

<p>Hide the legend for a specific column. This only has one option <em>hide</em>.</p>

<h4>weight</h4>

<p>Weighting (ordering) allows you to change the position of column/groups without having to update the
    source dataset. Heaver items sink to the end of lists, lighter items float to the top.</p>

<p>If you wanted an column to appear first, you could set a really low weight of <strong>-50</strong>.
    Alternatively if you wanted a column to appear last you could set a high weight of <strong>50</strong>.
    Any positive or negative integer is valid.</p>

<h4>style</h4>

<p>This currently only applies to line graphs and it allows you to set the line to be <strong>dashed</strong>.</p>

<h4>class</h4>

<p>Adding a css class to a column allows additional custom styling. Currently there is one 'out of the box' style
available <strong>hide-points</strong> that hide the points for a specific column.</p>

<p>You can add any classes you like and then define those styles is your custom css.</p>
