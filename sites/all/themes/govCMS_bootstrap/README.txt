Next review point ..... naming conventions.
For govcms if you are creating a module that is potentially generic enough to be pushed back into the distro codebase then this should start with 'govCMS_'
For all modules specific to the APS build ... these should start with 'apsjobs_' and belong to the 'APSJobs' package. (edited)
